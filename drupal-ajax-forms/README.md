# Ajax Loaded Form Example

This is an example of an ajax loaded form that uses drupal's ajax framework for submit and delivery.

As of 2015-02-09, the method has been tested on a production site, but I generalized all ids, classes, etc.. so if it doesn't work, that's where I'd start. 

I'd change all instances of 'ajax_form' or 'ajax-form' to whatever you want to name your module.
